class Result(dict):
    """ Represents the optimization result.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        The solution of the optimization.
    success : bool
        Whether or not the optimizer exited successfully.
    status : int
        Termination status of the optimizer. Its value depends on the
        underlying solver. Refer to `message` for details.
    message : str
        Description of the cause of the termination.
    fun, jac, hess : ndarray
        Values of objective function, Jacobian and Hessian (if available).
    nfev, njev, nhev : int
        Number of evaluations of the objective functions and of its
        Jacobian and Hessian.
    nit : int
        Number of iterations performed by the optimizer.
    maxcv : float
        The maximum constraint violation.

    Notes
    -----
    There may be additional attributes not listed above depending of the
    specific solver. Since this class is essentially a subclass of dict
    with attribute accessors, one can see which attributes are available
    using the `keys()` method.
