    -----
    This algorithm starts from a completely disconnected graph and adds
    transition states one at a time, starting from the lowest energy transition
    state.  Connectivity is determined solely through labeling minima based on
    which cluster it's in.  If a new transition
    state connects two previously disconnected clusters, the clusters are
    joined to make one single cluster.  As the transition states are added
    (sorted in energy) the energy levels are reached one at a time.  At each
    level, the state of the connectivity of the graph is saved in tree graphs.
    
    This algorithm is very similar to kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : a networkx graph
        a graph with Minimum objects as nodes and transition
        states defining the edges.  You can use the function
        database2graph() defined in this module to create this 
        from a database.
        
        >>> from pele.utils.disconnectivity_graph import database2graph
        >>> graph = database2graph(database)
        >>> dg = DisconnectivityGraph(graph)
         
    nlevels : int
        how many levels at which to bin the transition states
    Emax : float
        maximum energy for transition state cutoff.  Default
        is the maximum energy of all transition states.

    minima : list of Minima
        a list of minima to ensure are displayed in the graph.
        e.g. they will be displayed even if they're in a connected
        cluster smaller than smaller than subgraph_size
    subgraph_size : int
        if subgraph_size is not None then all disconnected graphs
        of size greater than subraph_size will be included.

    order_by_energy : bool
        order the subtrees by placing ones with lower energy closer
        to the center
    order_by_basin_size : bool
        order the subtrees by placing larger basins closer to the center
    center_gmin : bool
        when a node splits into its daughter
        nodes, the one containing the global minimum is always placed centrally
        (even if other nodes carry more minima). This does not guarantee that
        the global minimum is central in the overall diagram because other
        nodes may push the one containing the global minimum over to one side
    include_gmin : bool
        make sure to include the global minimum, even if it is not part of the
        main connected region
    node_offset : float
        offset between 0 and 1 for how to draw the angled lines.
        0 for no angle, draw horizontally out then vertically down.  1 for 
        angled lines all the way to the next energy level        
    energy_attribute : string, optional
        attribute which contains energy. default is energy. This attribute can
        be used to generate free energy disconnectivity graphs
    order_by_value : callable, optional, `v = order_by_value(m)`
        If this function is passed the minima at each level will be sorted by this value
        with small values to the left.  A group of minima will be sorted according to the 
        smallest value in the group.
