"""
example for how to modify parameters in the double ended connect routine

This example will be based on a cluster of 38 Lennard-Jones atoms.
We will load two sets of coordinates from a file, minimize them, and try to find
a connected set of minima and transition states betweeen them.

For more information about how to change parameters, see the documentation
for the system class, the parameter tree and DoubleEndedConnect.

See the class LJCluster for what the default parameters are for this system

"""
double ended connect is a heierarchical routine where you have functions calling functions which
then call functions.  In order to reproduce this logically the parameters are stored in 
heierarchichal dictionaries in the system class starting with system.params 

there are many more parameters which can be adjusted.  Some can have a large effect
on how fast you find a connection and how direct that connection is.  There are
additional tools in the gui (neb explorer, connect explorer, etc) for finding good 
parameters.

Ultimately, if you find a good parameter set for your system, you should add the
changes to your system class.  Then they will be set by default every time you
call system.get_double_ended_connect()
