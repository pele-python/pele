"""
example for how to run a double ended connect routine without using the system class.
We strongly recommend not doing it this way and setting up a system class first.  It
will be much easier for you.

We will do the connections for a cluster of 38 Lennard-Jones atoms.
We will load two sets of coordinates from a file, minimize them, and try to find
a connected set of minima and transition states betweeen them.
